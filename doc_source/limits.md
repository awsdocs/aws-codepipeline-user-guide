# Limits in AWS CodePipeline<a name="limits"></a>

The following table lists current limits in AWS CodePipeline\. Structural requirements are discussed in [AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference](reference-pipeline-structure.md)\. For information about limits that can be changed, see [AWS Service Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_codepipeline)\.


|  |  | 
| --- |--- |
|  Maximum number of pipelines per region in an AWS account  |  US East \(N\. Virginia\) \(us\-east\-1\): 40 US West \(Oregon\) \(us\-west\-2\): 60 EU \(Ireland\) \(eu\-west\-1\): 60 All other supported regions: 20  | 
|  Number of stages in a pipeline  |  Minimum of 2, maximum of 10  | 
|  Number of actions in a stage  |  Minimum of 1, maximum of 20  | 
| Maximum number of custom actions per region in an AWS account | Maximum of 50 | 
| Maximum number of parallel actions in a stage | Maximum of 10 | 
| Maximum number of sequential actions in a stage | Maximum of 10 | 
| Maximum number of webhooks per region in an AWS account | Maximum of 300 | 
|  Length of time before an action times out  |  Approval action: 7 days AWS CloudFormation deployment action: 3 days AWS CodeBuild build action and test action: 8 hours AWS CodeDeploy deployment action: 7 days AWS Lambda invoke action: 1 hour  AWS CodePipeline waits one hour to determine if a Lambda function failed\. If the action times out, AWS CodePipeline sets the invoke action state to failed\. AWS Lambda has different limits\. The default for the AWS Lambda function timeout is 3 seconds, but you can set this limit to up to 300 seconds\.  All other actions: 1 hour  | 
| Number of days before a stage execution times out | 40  The sum total of timeout periods for consecutive actions you add to a stage cannot exceed 40 days\.  | 
| Maximum number of prior months for which pipeline execution history information can be viewed | 12 | 
|  Regions where you can create a pipeline  |  US East \(Ohio\) \(us\-east\-2\) US East \(N\. Virginia\) \(us\-east\-1\) US West \(N\.

| Maximum size of artifacts in a source stage |  Artifacts stored in Amazon S3 buckets: 2 GB Artifacts stored in AWS CodeCommit or GitHub repositories: 1 GB Exception: If you are using Amazon EBS to deploy applications, the maximum artifact size is always 512 MB\.  | 
| Maximum size of input artifacts for AWS CloudFormation actions | If you are using AWS CloudFormation to deploy Lambda functions, the Lambda code archive size should not exceed 256 MB\. See [AWS Lambda Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html)\. | 
| Uniqueness of names |  Within a single AWS account, each pipeline you create in a region must have a unique name\. Names can be reused for pipelines in different regions\.  Stage names must be unique within a pipeline\. Action names must be unique within a stage\.  | 
| Characters allowed in pipeline name |  Pipeline names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.   | 
| Characters allowed in stage name |  Stage names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in action name |  Action names cannot exceed 100 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in action types |  Action type names cannot exceed 25 characters\. Allowed characters include: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\. The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\. The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\. Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\.  | 
| Characters allowed in partner action names | Partner action names must follow the same naming conventions and restrictions as other action names in AWS CodePipeline\. Specifically, they cannot exceed 100 characters, and the following characters are allowed: The letter characters `a` through `z`, inclusive\.The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\.The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\.The special characters `.` \(period\), `@` \(at sign\), `-` \(minus sign\), and `_` \(underscore\)\.Any other characters, such as spaces, are not allowed\. | 
|  Maximum size of the JSON object that can be stored in the `ParameterOverrides` property  | For an AWS CodePipeline deploy action with AWS CloudFormation as the provider, the ParameterOverrides property is used to store a JSON object that specifies values for the AWS CloudFormation template configuration file\. There is a maximum size limit of 1 kilobyte for the JSON object that can be stored in the ParameterOverrides property\. | 
|  Maximum size of the image definitions JSON file used in pipelines deploying Amazon ECS containers and images  | 100 KB | 
|  Maximum size of CloudFormation template file  | For an AWS CodePipeline deploy action with AWS CloudFormation as the provider there is a maximum size limit of 51,200 bytes for the template file\. |
