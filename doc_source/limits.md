The letter characters `A` through `Z`, inclusive\. The number characters `0` through `9`, inclusive\.

|  Maximum size of the JSON object that can be stored in the `ParameterOverrides` property  | For an AWS CodePipeline deploy action with AWS CloudFormation as the provider, the ParameterOverrides property is used to store a JSON object that specifies values for the AWS CloudFormation template configuration file\.
